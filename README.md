## Prerequisites
You need to have NodeJS installed in order to use this.

## Getting started

```
In the project repository:

npm install

npm start

In the server repository:

node chatserver.js

```

When you have run npm start, the browser opens up on localhost: 1337, then you have to put in your user name and you will see the chat window pop up after that. there you can write messages in the default chat room or the lobby. on the navigation bar to the left of the chat window you can write the name of another chat room and join it to talk to others online!
